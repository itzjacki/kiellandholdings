# kiellandholdings.com

This is the homepage of Kielland Holdings LLC., my fictional, satire, hyper-corporate holding company. Kielland Holdings LLC. originated on a minecraft server I played on with my friends, and grew into a running joke among our group. I figured it was time to give it a proper website.

Thanks to Astro for making web dev so fun that I had the motivation to do this ðŸ©µ
